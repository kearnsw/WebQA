It is treated with medication that reduces copper absorption or removes the excess copper from the body, but occasionally a liver transplant is required.\\nThe condition is due to mutations in the Wilson disease protein (ATP7B) gene. A single abnormal copy of the gene is present in 1 in 100 people, who do not develop any symptoms (they are carriers). If a child inherits the gene from both parents, they may develop Wilson's disease. Symptoms usually appear between the ages of 6 and 20 years, but cases in much older patients have been described. \\nVarious treatments are available for Wilson's disease. Some increase the removal of copper from the body, while others prevent the absorption of copper from the diet. In general, a diet low in copper-containing foods (mushrooms, nuts, chocolate, dried fruit, liver, and shellfish) is recommended.\\nGenerally, penicillamine is the first treatment used. This binds copper (chelation) and leads to excretion of copper in the urine. Hence, monitoring of the amount of copper in the urine can be done to ensure a sufficiently high dose is taken. Penicillamine is not without problems: about 20% of patients experience a side effect or complicaton of penicillamine treatment, such as drug-induced lupus (causing joint pains and a skin rash) or myasthenia (a nerve condition leading to muscle weakness). In those who presented with neurological symptoms, almost half experience a paradoxical worsening in their symptoms. While this phenomenon is also observed in other treatments for Wilson's, it is usually taken as an indication for discontinuing penicillamine and commencing second-line treatment. Patients intolerant to penicillamine may instead be commenced on trientine hydrochloride, which also has chelating properties. Some recommend trientine as first-line treatment, but experience with penicillamine is more extensive\\nYou can be in touch in with other members through http://www.wilsonsdisease.org/\\n\\n\\nRefer: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilson's_disease\\n\\n\\nBest</td>\n",

WaldenstrÃ¶m macroglobulinemia is a condition characterized by the presence of a high level of a macroglobulin (immunoglobulin M [IgM]), elevated serum viscosity, and the presence of a lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate in the bone marrow. WaldenstrÃ¶m macroglobulinemia is a clonal disorder of B lymphocytes. \\nThe clinical manifestations of this condition result from the presence of the IgM paraprotein and malignant lymphoplasmacytic cell infiltration of the bone marrow and other tissue sites. The clinical presentation of WaldenstrÃ¶m macroglobulinemia is similar to that of multiple myeloma (MM) except that (1) organomegaly is common in WaldenstrÃ¶m macroglobulinemia and is uncommon in multiple myeloma and (2) lytic bony disease and renal disease are uncommon in WaldenstrÃ¶m macroglobulinemia but are common in multiple myeloma. Patients who meet criteria for WaldenstrÃ¶m macroglobulinemia (serum IgM monoclonal protein, bone marrow lymphoplasmacytic infiltration, or both) without end-organ damage are considered to have indolent disease or smoldering WaldenstrÃ¶m macroglobulinemia. No treatment is indicated for asymptomatic disease. Patients can be observed carefully with periodic measurement of the M component, immunoglobulin, and serum viscosity. Therapeutic intervention of WaldenstrÃ¶m macroglobulinemia can be divided into treatment of IgM paraprotein complications and treatment of the disease per se. Current therapy available include plasmapheresis, alkylating agents, interferon alfa, purine nucleoside analogues, high-dose chemotherapy, splenectomy, rituximab (anti-CD20 antibody), thalidomide, bone marrow transplantation, and other new agents.\\n\\nRefer: http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic2395.htm\\n\\nBest</td>\n",

The differential diagnosis of the lymphnode enlargement causes includes infectious, inflammatory or neoplastic processes. Common causes include tuberculosis, respiratory tract disease, and lung tumor and lung cancer. You would be required to undergo a CTSCAN, MRI, tomography and lymphogram. This would confirm the adenopathy and help in diagnosis of the etiology of the enlargement. The presence of the precarinal lymph node though also means it may not be lung cancer but be a primary disease of the lymph nodes such as a lymphoma. Do you have fever, night sweats or loss of weight? A biopsy is warranted to confirm. In addition, your clinical symptoms need to be correlated with before any assumptions are made. Are you a chronic smoker?

What I can tell you though is that Propanolol is a Beta Blocker used for the preventative treatment of migraine headaches and that Fioricet is a butalbital that is sometimes used for the acute treatment of migraine headache. Fioricet also has acetaminophen and caffeine in it too, as well as the main butalbital medication; and because it has acetaminophen and caffeine in it, it is not an appropriate medication to take daily or multiple times a week for the acute treatment of migraine headache because it will likely cause rebound headache if taken often, although taking it a few times a month is fine. I take a beta blocker but I do not take propanolol so I really couldn't tell you about drug interactions. With the beta blocker I take, I think this combination would be fine, but different beta blockers may have different interactions. I would check with your pharmacist.

       "0      Hi\\nWelcome to the MedHelp forum!\\nAs the disease progresses, spinal cord symptoms appear. This can cause aches and pains in legs, arms, trunk etc. You may feel pain on pressing or touching certain points. However such aches and pains can also be due to chronic fatigue syndrome, severe anemia, pressure urticaria, peripheral neuropathies due to diabetes and hypothyroidism too. \\nPlease discuss with your neurologist as a confirmed diagnosis cannot be given on net. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "1      Hello Me4365,\\nThe following information would be of great help.\\nWilson's disease or hepatolenticular degeneration is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder in which copper accumulates in tissues; this manifests as neurological or psychiatric symptoms and liver disease. It is treated with medication that reduces copper absorption or removes the excess copper from the body, but occasionally a liver transplant is required.\\nThe condition is due to mutations in the Wilson disease protein (ATP7B) gene. A single abnormal copy of the gene is present in 1 in 100 people, who do not develop any symptoms (they are carriers). If a child inherits the gene from both parents, they may develop Wilson's disease. Symptoms usually appear between the ages of 6 and 20 years, but cases in much older patients have been described. \\nVarious treatments are available for Wilson's disease. Some increase the removal of copper from the body, while others prevent the absorption of copper from the diet. In general, a diet low in copper-containing foods (mushrooms, nuts, chocolate, dried fruit, liver, and shellfish) is recommended.\\nGenerally, penicillamine is the first treatment used. This binds copper (chelation) and leads to excretion of copper in the urine. Hence, monitoring of the amount of copper in the urine can be done to ensure a sufficiently high dose is taken. Penicillamine is not without problems: about 20% of patients experience a side effect or complicaton of penicillamine treatment, such as drug-induced lupus (causing joint pains and a skin rash) or myasthenia (a nerve condition leading to muscle weakness). In those who presented with neurological symptoms, almost half experience a paradoxical worsening in their symptoms. While this phenomenon is also observed in other treatments for Wilson's, it is usually taken as an indication for discontinuing penicillamine and commencing second-line treatment. Patients intolerant to penicillamine may instead be commenced on trientine hydrochloride, which also has chelating properties. Some recommend trientine as first-line treatment, but experience with penicillamine is more extensive\\nYou can be in touch in with other members through http://www.wilsonsdisease.org/\\n\\n\\nRefer: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilson's_disease\\n\\n\\nBest   \n",
       "2      Hi,\\nHow are you? Central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) is a common retinal vascular disorder that presents with variable visual loss. Because the exact pathogenesis of the CRVO is not known, various medical modalities of treatment have been advocated with varying success such as medication, Plasmapheresis, or systemic anticoagulation with warfarin, heparin, and alteplase. For proper management, it is best that you discuss this with your ophthalmologist. Management will depend on variety of factors such as age and medical history of patient, extent and symptoms present. Take care and best regards.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "3      Hi,\\nHow are you? Nocardia infection,  a disorder affecting the lungs, brain, or skin usually  occurs mainly in people with weakened immune systems. Symptoms depend on the  location of the organism and the length of transmission also varies. Pneumonia caused by nocardia may be indistinguishable from other pneumonias and usually develops over weeks, but may be acute in the very immunocompromised. Hope this helps.

       "4      Hi,\\nHow are you? To be diagnosed with ALS, signs and symptoms of both upper and lower motor neuron damage that cannot be attributed to other causes must be present.  There is no specific test that can provide a definitive diagnosis of ALS. Diagnosis is primarily based on the symptoms and signs and a series of tests including electromyography (EMG), nerve conduction velocity (NCV), MRI, blood and urine tests may be done  to rule out other diseases.

       "7      Hi! \\nIt is possible to feel tremors all over the body. Tremors are often associated with drugs, alcohol, smoking, lack of sleep, poor sleep patterns, stress and fatigue. They can be seen in peripheral neuropathies of diabetes, in hyperthyroidism, parasomnia, multiple sclerosis, TIAs or transient ischemic attacks or mini strokes, hypoglycemia, disorders of calcium metabolism, hyperparathyroidism etc. Certain epilepsies too could be the cause. Consult an internal medicine specialist or your PCP. Discuss these possibilities with your doctor.  A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. You will need blood sugar monitoring, MRI of brain and cervical spine, T3, T4, TSH, sleep studies, serum electrolytes, brain EEG, etc to reach a diagnosis. Treatment will follow diagnosis.

       "10     Hi, \\nHow are you? Conservative treatment for hemorrhoids include avoidance of straining, hot sitz bath, increased fluid intake and high fiber diet. There are hemorrhoidal creams available in the market that you can use. Aggressive therapy is reserved for patients who have persistent symptoms after 1 month of conservative therapy.   There are different stages for internal hemorrhoids:  Stage I - Internal hemorrhoids that bleed; Stage II â Internal hemorrhoids that cause bleeding and prolapse with straining but return to their resting point by themselves; Stage III - Internal hemorrhoids that bleed and prolapse with straining and require manual effort for replacement into the anal canal and  Stage IV - Internal hemorrhoids that do not return into the anal canal and are therefore constantly outside.

       "12     Below is info I found on the web.....\\nI hope this is helpful\\n************************************************************************************************\\n\\nBefore the Procedure\\nA health care provider often will find these defects before birth using fetal ultrasound. The doctor will follow the fetus very closely until birth. It is better if you're infant is carried to full term. Your doctor will want to do a cesarean section (C-section). This will prevent further damage to the sac or exposed spinal tissue.\\n\\nAfter the Procedure\\nYour child will usually need to spend about 2 weeks in the hospital after surgery. The child must lay flat without touching the wound area. After surgery, your child will receive antibiotics to prevent infection.\\n\\nMRI or ultrasound of the brain is repeated after surgery to see if hydrocephalus develops once the defect in the back is repaired.\\n\\nYour child may need physical, occupational, and speech therapy. Many children with these problems have gross (large) and fine (small) motor disabilities, and swallowing problems, early in life.\\n\\nThe child may need to see a team of medical experts in spina bifida often after they are discharged from the hospital.\\n\\nOutlook (Prognosis)\\nHow well a child does depends on the initial condition of their spinal cord and nerves. After a meningocele repair, children often do very well and have no further brain, nerve, or muscle problems.\\n\\nChildren born with myelomeningocele usually have paralysis or weakness of the muscles below the level of their spine where the defect is. They also may not be able to control their bladder or bowels. They will likely need medical and educational support for many years.\\n\\nThe ability to walk and control bowel and bladder function depends where the birth defect was on the spine. Defects lower down on the spinal cord may have a better outcome                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "13     Hi, \\nHow are you? Amyloidosis is a group of diseases resulting from the abnormal deposition of a particular protein, called amyloid, in various tissues of the body. Systemic amyloidosis has been classified into three major types: primary (AL), secondary (AA), and hereditary (ATTR). Symptoms in patients with amyloidosis depends on the organs involved. As a result, symptoms are vague and can not indicate which type or stage. Diagnosis of the stage or specific amyloidosis is made by detecting the characteristic amyloid protein in a biopsy specimen of involved tissue.  have this evaluated further for proper management.

       "17     Hello joanzone,\\nThe following information would be of great help.\\n\\n\\nWaldenstrÃ¶m macroglobulinemia is one of the malignant monoclonal gammopathies. WaldenstrÃ¶m macroglobulinemia is a condition characterized by the presence of a high level of a macroglobulin (immunoglobulin M [IgM]), elevated serum viscosity, and the presence of a lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate in the bone marrow. WaldenstrÃ¶m macroglobulinemia is a clonal disorder of B lymphocytes. \\nThe clinical manifestations of this condition result from the presence of the IgM paraprotein and malignant lymphoplasmacytic cell infiltration of the bone marrow and other tissue sites. The clinical presentation of WaldenstrÃ¶m macroglobulinemia is similar to that of multiple myeloma (MM) except that (1) organomegaly is common in WaldenstrÃ¶m macroglobulinemia and is uncommon in multiple myeloma and (2) lytic bony disease and renal disease are uncommon in WaldenstrÃ¶m macroglobulinemia but are common in multiple myeloma. Patients who meet criteria for WaldenstrÃ¶m macroglobulinemia (serum IgM monoclonal protein, bone marrow lymphoplasmacytic infiltration, or both) without end-organ damage are considered to have indolent disease or smoldering WaldenstrÃ¶m macroglobulinemia. No treatment is indicated for asymptomatic disease. Patients can be observed carefully with periodic measurement of the M component, immunoglobulin, and serum viscosity. Therapeutic intervention of WaldenstrÃ¶m macroglobulinemia can be divided into treatment of IgM paraprotein complications and treatment of the disease per se. Current therapy available include plasmapheresis, alkylating agents, interferon alfa, purine nucleoside analogues, high-dose chemotherapy, splenectomy, rituximab (anti-CD20 antibody), thalidomide, bone marrow transplantation, and other new agents.\\n\\nRefer: http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic2395.htm\\n\\nBest                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

The lesions are frequently bilateral and in various stages of evolution, typically resolving in weeks to months and leaving circumscribed areas of retinal pigment epithelial disturbance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "21     Hey there, \\nFor so many years I thought I had an underlying... Something... And nothing ever showed.. However, I peeled back some of the medications I was on and my symptoms went away. Additionally I take an anti inflammatory (herbal) and I realize I don't have the constant mysterious symptoms.. \\nFood intolerances or leaky gut can cause a variety of issues-- your gut is a big part of your immune system. Maybe start with a probiotic and see if you can pinpoint any foods that make things better/worse. Also don't rule out medication side effects (if you take any). Hope this helps!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

       "23     Hi,\\nHow are you? Are there other symptoms present? If you are referring to what we call a dirty sclera, this could be part of aging process, or combination of environmental pollutants and  excessive exposure to dust.  In the elderly, fatty deposits on the sclera can make it appear slightly yellow. You may also benefit from further evaluation to rule out medical conditions such as jaundice.

       "24     Hi,\\nHow are you? The cause of FSGS or focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and prolactinoma are  both âidiopathic,â Other possible causes of prolactin overproduction to be considered include medications, other types of pituitary tumors, an underactive thyroid gland, or an injury to the chest, pregnancy and breast-feeding. It is difficult to say if there is association with the two conditions.  It is best that you discuss this with your doctor for proper evaluation.

       "27     Hi,\\nThere has been many studies done in determining link of agent orange to cancer. According to cancer.org, sufficient evidence of an association to agent orange iinclude cancer types such as soft tissue sarcoma, Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), Hodgkin disease, Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), including hairy cell leukemia and other chronic B-cell leukemias. Limited or suggestive evidence of an association include prostatre cancer, multiple myeloma, and respiratory cancers such as lung, trachea, bronchus, and  larynx. Hope this helps.

       "28     Hi there. Any enlargement or swelling of the precarinal lymph nodes is called as precarinal lymphadenopathy. The differential diagnosis of the lymphnode enlargement causes includes infectious, inflammatory or neoplastic processes. Common causes include tuberculosis, respiratory tract disease, and lung tumor and lung cancer. You would be required to undergo a CTSCAN, MRI, tomography and lymphogram. This would confirm the adenopathy and help in diagnosis of the etiology of the enlargement. The presence of the precarinal lymph node though also means it may not be lung cancer but be a primary disease of the lymph nodes such as a lymphoma. Do you have fever, night sweats or loss of weight? A biopsy is warranted to confirm. In addition, your clinical symptoms need to be correlated with before any assumptions are made. Are you a chronic smoker? Any symptoms of weight loss, feeling easy fatiguability, pale, cough, chest pain, breathlessness and blood in sputum need to be correlated. consult an oncologist/pulmonologist for follwup and detailed evaluation.

       "10992  I start feeling some cramping around 6:00 pm, ate dinner, watched some TV, and the cramping started getting a little stronger. Took a shower around 7:00, cramps died down but I started timing them. After an hour of timing them they were about 5 min apart and 40 sec long. Pain was like a bad a period cramp, but then it went away after each contraction. Headed to hospital, got there at 9:30, walked in & got checked and was 8cm. I couldn't believe it. Pain really started kicking in once admitted. Like full on can't breathe, move, or think kind of pain. Got epidural (didn't even feel it go in) & baby arrived at 12:55. Recovery has been harder & more painful then labor. I'd rather do labor again than go thru recovery pain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

       "11007  Hi,\\nHow are you? Vasculitis refers to a large group of diseases involving inflammation of the blood vessels. It can include central nervous system vasculitis,  a type of vasculitis that also involves the brain and spinal cord as well as Giant Cell Arteritis or inflammation of the walls of the arteries. Both of these may present with headache. The cause may be idiopathic or due to secondary causes such as infection, allergy or immune system disorders. Diagnostic tests such as blood and imaging studies are important considerations in the diagnosis. It is best that you discuss this with your doctor for proper evaluation. Your medical history and symptoms present are important factors also.

       "11008  Hi,\\nHow are you? I'm sorry to hear what you have been through for the last 30 years. What diagnostic tests were done in the past? With migraine headaches, it is important to identify and avoid the possible triggers. A headache journal  or the migraine tracker in this forum may be very helpful. Triggers may be due to certain foods, hormonal changes, changes in altitude, weather, lights, and even emotional stress. Prescription medications including  both acute and preventive medications may also help provide relief with the symptoms. You may also benefit from complementary and alternative medicine such as acupuncture and  biofeedback therapy. Check with your doctor or be referred to a neurologist for proper management.

And currently my trigeminal neuralgia is down to a dull roar, but it was at pain levels of 10 at times.  I took Trileptal which gave me the worst migraines that I have had.  Had to stop it, but it took care of the terrible mouth pain.  What about you?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

       "11011  Hi,\\nHow are you? For hypertensive patients, it is recommended to have a low salt diet to manage hypertension.  It is unlikely for a such diet to cause an increase in blood pressure. It is possible though that other factors such as presence of other medical condition, stress, or environmental issues contribute to the increase. If there is nose bleeding or epistaxis, it is best that you have this evaluated also by an ENT specialist. Regular blood pressure monitoring and follow-up with attending physician is highly recommended.

       "11012  Hi and welcome to the Migraines & Headaches Community.\\n\\nIt is rare for me to go a day without a migraine and lots of times I have more than on migraine in a day. It's called Cluster Migraines. They are migraines but, not as severe and more frequently than a full blown migraine.\\nExcedrin works wonderful for me. It is a combo of Tylenol, Aspirin and Caffeine which is a great combo for migraines. You can also wrap something around your head...like a bandanna. What I use is those cloth headbands, they work great. A bit tight at first but they loosen up as you wear them. What causes migraines is the blood vessels in your brain get dilated so, putting light pressure on them helps relieve the pain.\\n\\nKeep us posted and let us know how you're doing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "11013  Hi,\\nHow are you? It is unlikely to see protruding or bulging veins after microdermabrasion. Spider veins may develop because of weak valves or backup of blood. They can also be caused by hormone changes, exposure to the sun, and injuries. Sclerotherapy and laser treatments may help in such conditions. Have this checked by your doctor for proper evaluation.

       "11016  Hi Sandy5342,\\n\\nI think that the best person to ask this question to would be the pharmacist you bought these medications from. \\n\\nOn medhelp, there is a \"Ask a Pharmacist\" forum as well, maybe posting this question there might be helpful to you too. This is the link to the forum: http://www.medhelp.org/forums/Ask-a-Pharmacist/show/296\\n\\nMost of us here are not doctors or pharmacists so we don't have the knowledge or the authority to answer that question.\\n\\nI am not a doctor or a pharmacists, so I can't answer your question. What I can tell you though is that Propanolol is a Beta Blocker used for the preventative treatment of migraine headaches and that Fioricet is a butalbital that is sometimes used for the acute treatment of migraine headache. Fioricet also has acetaminophen and caffeine in it too, as well as the main butalbital medication; and because it has acetaminophen and caffeine in it, it is not an appropriate medication to take daily or multiple times a week for the acute treatment of migraine headache because it will likely cause rebound headache if taken often, although taking it a few times a month is fine. I take a beta blocker but I do not take propanolol so I really couldn't tell you about drug interactions. With the beta blocker I take, I think this combination would be fine, but different beta blockers may have different interactions. I would check with your pharmacist. You could also read the patient information that came with the two medications to check for listed interactions. \\n\\nHope that helps! :)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "11017  Hi,\\nHow are you? Diclofenac belongs to the group of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines while amitriptyline in the drug class tricyclic antidepressants. So far, there are no mentioned interactions of these drugs but it is best that you talk to your doctor first  prior to taking any medications. Factors to be taken into consideration include your medical history and presence of co-morbid conditions.

       "11018  Hi,\\n\\nI just asked my doctor about this and he said that they are using Botox to treat headaches. But they do a series of 31 shots and it is not plesant. It burns. They put them all over your forehead and a few in the back of the head. The doctor I asked was in the chronic pain management clinic at Kaiser Permanente in California. He told me that the patient had to fail two preventative treatments before they would consider this as a treatment.\\n\\nAnother doctor that I had seen previously, a ENT doctor had recommended Botox for tention headaches.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "11019  Hi, \\nHow are you? Craniotomy is indicated for brain tumors, infections, abscesses, cerebral edema and bleeding within the skull. Like any operation, there are possible effects and complications of the surgery such as allergic reaction to the anesthetic, injury from the head pin fixing device, injury to facial muscle and sinuses, infection of the bone flap, seizures, bleeding, brain damage, brain swelling and even stroke. Prior to any operation, these are discussed by your surgeon and anesthesiologist.

       "11021  Hi,\\nThank you for posting. Charging of patients depends on each doctor. Some do not charge during follow-up while others do, especially if there is a procedure done at that time. It is best that you talk to your surgeon about this and ask for clarification.
