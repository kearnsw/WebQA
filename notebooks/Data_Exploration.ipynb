Aggressive therapy is reserved for patients who have persistent symptoms after 1 month of conservative therapy.   There are different stages for internal hemorrhoids:  Stage I - Internal hemorrhoids that bleed; Stage II – Internal hemorrhoids that cause bleeding and prolapse with straining but return to their resting point by themselves; Stage III - Internal hemorrhoids that bleed and prolapse with straining and require manual effort for replacement into the anal canal and  Stage IV - Internal hemorrhoids that do not return into the anal canal and are therefore constantly outside.

       "0     Hi! \\nSince you are a female and in menopausal age , night sweats are a common occurrence. This can be corrected by hormone replacement therapy. Other causes include AIDS, cancer (Hodgkin's Lymphoma), infections in the body and side effect of certain drugs. It can also be due to severe acidity with H pylori infection and gastric reflux, hypoglycemia, carcinoid syndromes, hyperthyroidism, and sleep disorders. At times cause cannot be found out.  \\n\\nSince a confirmed diagnosis cannot be given on net please consult your doctor regarding this. Hope this helps.

       "3     Hi,\\nHow are you? Indeed, acinetobacter infections have been identified in hospitalized patients and health care related outbreaks especially in critically ill patients receiving invasive medical  interventions such as central lines, arterial lines, and mechanical ventilation . And in recent years, like methyl resistant staph aureaus, this group of microorganism has been increasingly recognized as a significant healthcare-associated, opportunistic, multidrug-resistant pathogen.  A culture and sensitivity test would help identify the medicine these microorganism may respond to.

       "5     Hi,\\nHow are you? Central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) is a common retinal vascular disorder that presents with variable visual loss. Because the exact pathogenesis of the CRVO is not known, various medical modalities of treatment have been advocated with varying success such as medication, Plasmapheresis, or systemic anticoagulation with warfarin, heparin, and alteplase. For proper management, it is best that you discuss this with your ophthalmologist. Management will depend on variety of factors such as age and medical history of patient, extent and symptoms present.

       "6     Hi \\nThanks for writing to the forum!\\nIf the symptoms persist then you need to look into it. There could be two possibilities. Any abnormal sensation can usually be explained by ‘restless leg syndrome’. “Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a neurological disorder characterized by unpleasant sensations in the legs and an uncontrollable urge to move them for relief.” You can read more about this on: http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/restless_legs/restless_legs.htm\\n The other possibility is deep vein thrombosis or deep vein clots. Usually angiograms or dopplar studies are required.\\nHope this helps. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Do consult your doctor.

       "8     Hi,\\nHow are you? To be diagnosed with ALS, signs and symptoms of both upper and lower motor neuron damage that cannot be attributed to other causes must be present.  There is no specific test that can provide a definitive diagnosis of ALS. Diagnosis is primarily based on the symptoms and signs and a series of tests including electromyography (EMG), nerve conduction velocity (NCV), MRI, blood and urine tests may be done  to rule out other diseases. Take care and best regards. \\n\\nI                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

       "12    Hi\\nWelcome to the MedHelp forum!\\nWhat you feel is probably pain and weakness of intermittent claudication where muscles spasm and then relax and then go into spasm again. It is commonly seen in patients with diabetes and hypertension. \\nAnother possibility is deep vein thrombosis. This can also cause pain due to poor blood supply to muscles. This can be known by dopplar studies. \\nAt times it can be due to a compressed spinal nerve in the lumbar area. This can be detected by nerve conduction studies and by MRI of the spine. \\nI think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor.  A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind.\\nPlease let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted.

Take care and regards.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "18    Hi! \\nIt is possible to feel tremors all over the body. Tremors are often associated with drugs, alcohol, smoking, lack of sleep, poor sleep patterns, stress and fatigue. They can be seen in peripheral neuropathies of diabetes, in hyperthyroidism, parasomnia, multiple sclerosis, TIAs or transient ischemic attacks or mini strokes, hypoglycemia, disorders of calcium metabolism, hyperparathyroidism etc. Certain epilepsies too could be the cause. Consult an internal medicine specialist or your PCP. Discuss these possibilities with your doctor.  A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. You will need blood sugar monitoring, MRI of brain and cervical spine, T3, T4, TSH, sleep studies, serum electrolytes, brain EEG, etc to reach a diagnosis. Treatment will follow diagnosis. Take care!\\n\\nThe medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you.

There are hemorrhoidal creams available in the market that you can use. Aggressive therapy is reserved for patients who have persistent symptoms after 1 month of conservative therapy.   There are different stages for internal hemorrhoids:  Stage I - Internal hemorrhoids that bleed; Stage II – Internal hemorrhoids that cause bleeding and prolapse with straining but return to their resting point by themselves; Stage III - Internal hemorrhoids that bleed and prolapse with straining and require manual effort for replacement into the anal canal and  Stage IV - Internal hemorrhoids that do not return into the anal canal and are therefore constantly outside.

       "5208  Hi!\\nI am sorry to hear about your grand-daughter. This loss of vision in the peripheral visual field can be due to optic nerve damage caused by glaucoma, high internal eye pressure, retinal detachment, occlusion of blood supply as in eye stroke, optic neuritis, and optic nerve edema. Tunnel vision is also possible after a history of head injury, concussion, brain damage and stroke, though all these causes may not be applicable in your grand-daughter's case. Headaches are very common symptoms of eye problems.\\nThe MRI scan will reveal more things.

       "5211  Hi,\\nHow are you? I'm sorry to hear what you have been through for the last 30 years. What diagnostic tests were done in the past? With migraine headaches, it is important to identify and avoid the possible triggers. A headache journal  or the migraine tracker in this forum may be very helpful. Triggers may be due to certain foods, hormonal changes, changes in altitude, weather, lights, and even emotional stress. Prescription medications including  both acute and preventive medications may also help provide relief with the symptoms. You may also benefit from complementary and alternative medicine such as acupuncture and  biofeedback therapy. Check with your doctor or be referred to a neurologist for proper management.

       "5215  Hi,\\nHow are you? For hypertensive patients, it is recommended to have a low salt diet to manage hypertension.  It is unlikely for a such diet to cause an increase in blood pressure. It is possible though that other factors such as presence of other medical condition, stress, or environmental issues contribute to the increase. If there is nose bleeding or epistaxis, it is best that you have this evaluated also by an ENT specialist. Regular blood pressure monitoring and follow-up with attending physician is highly recommended.

       "5217  Hi,\\nHow are you? I have not tried treximet but according to literature, Treximet ( combination of sumatriptan and naproxen) may have any of the the following side effects:   dizziness, drowsiness, constipation, indigestion, dry mouth, numbnes or tingly feeling, redness in your face,  tight muscles,  or mild pressure or heavy feeling in any part of your body. It can only treat a headache that has already begun and will not prevent headaches or reduce the number of attacks. Treximet should not be used to treat a migraine that causes visual aura with weakness on one side of the body, speech problems, or ringing in the ears. I hope this helps.

       "5222  Hi, \\nHow are you? Migraines headaches are primary headaches which means that there is no underlying medical condition and there is no history of trauma. It can be triggered by several factors such as food, weather, altitude and many others. To prevent them from happening, it is important that you identify the possible triggers of your headache. There is a headache/migraine tracker here in Medhelp that may help. Rest, ice packs and other pain medications prescribed by your doctor can help provide relief. Try to avoid using over-the-counter pain medicines because these can lead to rebound headaches.

       "5229  Hi, \\nHow are you? Occipital neuralgias can be successfully treated with micro vascular nerve decompression. Occipital nerve block is a simple, and safe diagnostic and therapeutic tool that should also be considered before surgery. Other options include occipital nerve blockade with local anesthetic, and steroid, then botulinum toxin or permanent implantation of a percutaneous occipital nerve stimulator. Microvascular nerve decompression often involves diagnostic anesthetic blockade, followed by chemical or surgical ablation of the greater occipital nerve. Depending on your surgeon, atlanto-epistrophic ligament decompression of the C 2 dorsal root ganglion and nerve or  C 2 ganglionotomy may be performed. Discuss these options with your doctor.

       "5235  Hi, \\nHow are you? Craniotomy is indicated for brain tumors, infections, abscesses, cerebral edema and bleeding within the skull. Like any operation, there are possible effects and complications of the surgery such as allergic reaction to the anesthetic, injury from the head pin fixing device, injury to facial muscle and sinuses, infection of the bone flap, seizures, bleeding, brain damage, brain swelling and even stroke. Prior to any operation, these are discussed by your surgeon and anesthesiologist.

       "5236  Hi, \\nHow is your husband?  The nose contains plenty of blood vessels and is situated in a vulnerable position because it protrudes on the face. If there was no trauma involved, nosebleeds can occur spontaneously when the nasal membranes dry out and crack. This is common in winter months or during dry climates when upper respiratory infections are more frequent, and the temperature and humidity fluctuate more dramatically. It can also be associated with headaches, infection, allergic and non-allergic rhinitis, hypertension, certain medications, and alcohol abuse. If it persists, have this checked by your doctor for proper evaluation.
